# Golf It! Autosplitter

This is an AutoSplitter Script for [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit). 

**Note this project is still work in progress, so be ready to undo a split with a Hotkey (in Settings) in Livesplit.**

The Script...
 ... starts, when you press "Start Match".
 ... splits, everytime you finish a Hole.
 ... resets, when you enter main menu. (you can disable this in the layout settings for the Scriptable AutoSplitter)

## All Maps
If you you want to use it for All Maps, make sure to not press "Exit" after you finish a Map, otherwise it will split the timer.

## Installing
 1. Open the current verions of the script [under this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sflofty/autosplitters/master/golf_it/golf_it.asl).
 2. Right Click on the text and Save Anywhere on the PC with file ending "golf_it.asl"
 3. Open LiveSplit > Edit Layout 
 4. Add Control > Scriptable AutoSplitter
 5. Browse for the file you just saved.
