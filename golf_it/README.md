# Golf It! Autosplitter

This is an AutoSplitter Script for [LiveSplit](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit). 

**Note this project is still work in progress, so be ready to undo a split with a Hotkey (in Settings) in Livesplit.**

The Script...
 ... starts, when you press "Start Match".
 ... splits, everytime you finish a Hole.
 ... resets, when you enter main menu. (you can disable this in the layout settings for the Scriptable AutoSplitter)

## All Maps (experimental)
If you you want to use it for All Maps, make sure to not press "Exit" after you finish a Map, otherwise it will split the timer.
The script will split after 18 Holes are finished. This is still experimental.

## Installing
 1. Download the current verion of the script [`golf_it.asl`](https://github.com/sflofty/autosplitters/releases)
 2. Open LiveSplit > Edit Layout 
 3. Add Control > Scriptable AutoSplitter
 4. Browse for `golf_it.asl`
